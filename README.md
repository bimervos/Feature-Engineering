# About Dataset

This dataset is a part of a large dataset held at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, and is used for a diabetes study conducted on Pima  Indian women aged 21 and above living in Phoenix, the fifth-largest city in the state of Arizona in the United States.  
The target variable is specified as "outcome", where 1 indicates a positive result of the diabetes test and 0 indicates a negative result.

A machine learning model is requested to be developed that can predict whether individuals have diabetes or not when their features are given. Before developing the model, performing the necessary data analysis and feature engineering steps are expected.

There are 9 variables in the dataset.  
Pregnancies: Number of pregnancies.  
Glucose: 2-hour plasma glucose concentration during an oral glucose tolerance test.  
Blood Pressure: Blood Pressure (Diastolic) (mm Hg).  
SkinThickness : Thickness of skin  
Insulin: 2-Hour Serum Insulin (mu U/ml)  
DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Function (2-hour plasma glucose concentration during an oral glucose tolerance test).  
BMI: Body Mass Index (weight in kg/(height in meters)^2)  Age: Persons age(in years)
Outcome: Having diabetes status (1: diabetes, 0: no diabetes)
